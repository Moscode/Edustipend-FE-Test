# Pre-work for the role of Front-end 		Engineer (React)
**Question**: From the task given, we are to identify the core components on a mockup design and then we are to design two out of the comonents.

**My Observation**: Regarding the skills reqirement that the suitable engineer should possess this pre-work doesn't encompass the test of all the skills. And I recognize that as a consideration from the recruiter.

**My Process**:
- I carefully observed the mockup and I defined a component as a reuseable function or class-based element used repetitively on the design.
- From the definition above, I was able to identified two components from the mockup design, which are: the button and trending song 
- I went ahead to initialize the app by creating a react app using vite 
- Then I created a folder named - components that contain the two components (Button and Trending Song tab)
- To further show the components, I designed every other parts that wasn't considered as a component inside the first layer (root of the app) i.e App.jsx
